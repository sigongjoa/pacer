# PACER V2 Architecture Overview

This document outlines the vision and core components of PACER V2, focusing on evolving from a manually-driven AI improvement cycle to an automated, self-improving system.

## V2 Vision
To transform PACER into an intelligent, self-optimizing educational AI platform where the LLM's performance continuously improves through automated feedback loops and data-driven insights.

## Key Pillars of V2
1.  **Automated Fine-tuning Pipeline:** Transition from manual prompt engineering to automated LLM fine-tuning using collected feedback data.
2.  **MLOps Foundation:** Establish robust MLOps practices for model versioning, deployment, and monitoring.
3.  **A/B Testing for Models and Prompts:** Implement a systematic approach to validate and roll out new model versions or prompt strategies.
4.  **Enhanced AI Capabilities:** Expand the scope of AI beyond just filtering, potentially integrating LLMs into more complex analysis and report generation.

## Next Steps
*   Develop data export scripts for fine-tuning datasets.
*   Design and implement the MLOps pipeline components.
*   Integrate A/B testing frameworks.
*   Explore advanced LLM applications within the PACER system.
